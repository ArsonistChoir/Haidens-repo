## About me

### I'm a aspiring coder looking into learning multiple languages so I can create a career in coding. Here to hoping it works out!

## Work Experience

### As far as formal jobs I've worked, I've only had one so far. I worked at a local Rural King for 7 monthas a cashier. I spent a large part of that time helping customers check out there items and clearing the front end of the store and the popcorn machine. While I don't have any previous coding experience, ***I'm trying to change that***.
